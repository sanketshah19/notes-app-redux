Three Field: 

collection - array
document - object
field - property of object

model is a constructor function

to talking with database we can't use express

MongoDB uses JS, POSTGRES uses SQL

Express to MongoDB is also an asynchronous opertaion

For SQL database we use Sequelize -- (But model is in JavaScript)

Static method - model
Instance method - Instances of Models are documents. 

MVC - skinny 
      fat 


(request) --> index.js --> routes.js(/config) --> controllers(express) (/app/controllers) --> models(mongoose) --> DB

in mordern JavaScript(React) we have no view --> React works as View


MVC folder structure: 

1. create app
    /controllers
        /notesController.js
    /models
        /note.js

2. create config
    /database.js
    /routes.js     

3. schema for a note & a model

4. create a notes controller

5. linked index to routes, routes to respective controllers, controllers to respective models
